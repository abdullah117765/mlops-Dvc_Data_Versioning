# Data Versioning with DVC, Git, GitHub, and Google Drive

## Prerequisites

1. **Git**: Ensure you have Git installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
2. **GitHub Account**: Create a GitHub account if you don't have one.
3. **DVC**: Install DVC using `pip install dvc`.
4. **Google Drive**: Ensure you have a Google Drive account.

## Initial Setup

### 1. Create a New Git Repository

1. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the project.
2. Initialize a new Git repository:

    ```bash
    git init my-dvc-project
    cd my-dvc-project
    ```

3. Create a new repository on GitHub and follow the instructions to link your local repository to the GitHub repository:

    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-dvc-project.git
    ```

### 2. Install and Initialize DVC

1. Initialize DVC in your project directory:

    ```bash
    dvc init
    ```

2. Commit the changes to Git:

    ```bash
    git add .dvc .gitignore
    git commit -m "Initialize DVC"
    git push -u origin main
    ```

### 3. Configure Google Drive as Remote Storage

1. Add Google Drive as a remote storage location for DVC:

    ```bash
    dvc remote add -d myremote gdrive://<Google-Drive-URL>
    ```

2. Ensure the remote configuration is saved and tracked by Git:

    ```bash
    git add .dvc/config
    git commit -m "Configure Google Drive as DVC remote storage"
    git push
    ```

## Working with DVC

### 1. Adding Data to DVC

1. Add your data file or directory to DVC:

    ```bash
    dvc add data/mydatafile.csv
    ```

2. This command will create a `.dvc` file tracking the data file:

    ```bash
    git add data/mydatafile.csv.dvc
    git commit -m "Add data file to DVC"
    git push
    ```

3. Push the data to the remote storage:

    ```bash
    dvc push
    ```

### 2. Retrieving Data from DVC

1. To retrieve the data from the remote storage, use the `dvc pull` command:

    ```bash
    dvc pull
    ```

2. This command will download the data files from the remote storage to your local workspace.

### 3. Tracking Changes and Versioning

1. When you make changes to your data, you need to update the DVC tracking:

    ```bash
    dvc add data/mydatafile.csv
    git add data/mydatafile.csv.dvc
    git commit -m "Update data file"
    git push
    dvc push
    ```

### 4. Collaborating with Others

1. When collaborating, team members can clone the GitHub repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-dvc-project.git
    cd my-dvc-project
    ```

2. They can then pull the data from the DVC remote storage:

    ```bash
    dvc pull
    ```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can effectively version your data using DVC, Git, GitHub, and Google Drive. This setup allows for robust data management and collaboration across different environments and team members.
